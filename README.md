# L'Angolo Nerd - React Native

this app is powered by `create-react-native-app` and `expo`.

## How can I get it
We are still developing it, so there is no `apk` ready to be installed. But if you want to try it anyway follow the development setup instructions.  

## Development setup
```
git clone git@github.com:langolonerdit/langolonerdRN.git langolonerd
cd langolonerd
npm install
npm start
```
You have to install [expo app](http://expo.io) on your phone and be on the same network with your devices.  
you can also connect the phone to your pc and use `npm run android` or `npm run ios`, please note that you still have to install expo.
